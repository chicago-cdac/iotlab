    "In this workshop, we'll explore the Internet of Thing from the IP/TCP networking (Internet Protocol / Transmission Control Protocol) perspective. We'll use Wireshark, Jupyter Notebook and a local (IoT Lab) API to gather relevant information about the connected devices. Precisely, we want to visualize in a world map the TCP connection end-point locations as well as volume of sent and received data over time. We are first using a .pcap (packet capture file) collected from a smart camera installed inside the lab. After the that, the same steps can be used to analyze a .pcap file collected from your laptop accessing your favorite web site.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other tracks: \n",
    "- IoT Networking - Data Collection - Using Single Board Computers to Collect and Monitor your Network Traffic. (TBD)\n",
    "- IoT Survey on open source components and IoT building blocks. (TBD)\n",
    "\n",
    "Requisites:\n",
    "- Mac/Windows/Linux OS with terminal\n",
    "- Python3/jupyter notebook/virtualenv+pip (https://jupyter.org/install)\n",
    "- Wireshark Application (https://www.wireshark.org/#download)\n",
    "- *bash* and *wget* via terminal\n",
    "- IoTLab's geoip API (Use it inside the IoT Lab, network 192.168.XXX.0/24)\n",
    "\n",
    "Motivation:\n",
    "\n",
    "It is no secret that the proliferation of connected devices is imposing challenges from security and privacy standpoints. Your home network used to be a safe place with a handful of very well known devices. Now, it's even hard to keep track of the total number of connected devices: temperature sensors, cameras, smart toys, refrigerators, just to name a few. Multiple technologies are used to enable these devices to communicate and to interact with each other: Bluetooth, Zigbee, Near Field Communication (NFC) are just examples of communication protocols. But when it comes to using the full set of features provided by your IoT application, in most cases, it is required an internet connection to allow the IoT sending and receiving data to the cloud, potentially compromising security and privacy. Beyond just hoping that the IoT designers and operators are doing the right thing keeping both backend and IoT software secure, there are a few concepts, tools and techniques that we can be used to expose how these devices operate. The goal of this exercise is to explore some of these techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this exercise you should be able to learn:\n",
    "- How to decode a network traffic capture file (pcap) into csv (comma separated values);\n",
    "- How to identify network packets from a specific devices in your network;\n",
    "- How to visualize the TCP/UDP endpoints for all the external established connections;\n",
    "- How to correlate activities and interaction with the IoT devices with a volume of sent and received data;  \n",

    "### 4. Visualizing IoT Network Traffic Over Time\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we want to inspect the TCP/UDP connections established by the device looking at the volume of data sent and received over the time duration of the packet capture. We used camera4.pcap, a good example of capturing a very well known interaction with a Samsung camera. We started and stopped a video session 2 times remaining idle for 1 or 2 minutes. The traffic capturing (wireshark, tshark or tcpdump) was running throughout the entire experiment session capturing both video sessions and the idle period. \n",
    "\n",
    "For a device like a camera, the volume of traffic is expected to increase abruptly and remain high as compared to the idle state. It should be relatively steady at a higher level during the video streaming period. If the camera isn't being used, minimal or no traffic is expected. Please keep in mind that smart cameras might even avoid send data if no movement is detected. Also, the behavior of other types of IoT devices should be different and it won't be always clear what would be the traffic pattern of your smart refrigerator, for example.\n",
    " \n",
    "If the packet capture only contains traffic for 1 or 2 devices with a few minutes, that's not really a problem to analyze, but if we are considering a dataset with multiple devices, it becomes really challenging to visualize, therefore better tools and methods are required. Not to mention, this is only a tiny snapshot in time. As you read this, tons of data are being generated to the point where only an automated / systematic approach to expose anomalies can make a difference.\n"
